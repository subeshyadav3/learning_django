# Django – Semester Learning Repository

## Course Overview

This repository supports a **one-semester, structured study of Django**, the high-level Python web framework used to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

The objective is **not** to memorize syntax, but to **understand web development from first principles** and implement Django correctly, idiomatically, and professionally.

By the end of the semester, a student should be able to:
- Explain how web applications work (request → response lifecycle)
- Design and build Django projects using best practices
- Implement authentication, databases, and APIs
- Write clean, maintainable, testable Django code
- Deploy a Django application in a production-like environment

## Prerequisites (Non-Negotiable)

Before starting Django, you **must** be comfortable with:

- Python fundamentals (functions, classes, modules)
- Basic OOP concepts
- HTML & CSS (basic layouts, forms)
- Basic SQL concepts
- Command line usage
- Git & GitHub basics

If any of these are weak, **fix them first**. Django will punish shallow foundations.
